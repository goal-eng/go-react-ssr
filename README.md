Go-SSR is a drop in plugin to **any** existing Go web framework to allow **server rendering** [React](https://react.dev/). It's powered by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and allows for passing props from Go to React with **type safety**.

<!--
# üí° Overview -->

Go-SSR was developed due to a lack of an existing product in the Go ecosystem that made it easy to build full-stack React apps. At the time, most Go web app projects were either built with a static React frontend with lots of client-side logic or html templates. I envisioned creating a new solution that would allow you to create full-stack Go apps with React but with logic being moved to the server and being able to pass that logic down with type-safe props. This project was inspired by [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/), but aims to be a plugin and not a framework.

# üìú Features

- Lightning fast compiling
- Auto generated Typescript structs for props
- Hot reloading
- Simple error reporting
- Production optimized
- Drop in to any existing Go web server

# üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Using the CLI tool

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mygp5BT.png" height="400" />

The easiest way to get a project up and running is by using the command line tool. Install it with the following command

```console
$ go install github.com/natewong1313/go-react-ssr/gossr-cli@latest
```

Then you can call the following command to create a project

```console
$ gossr-cli create
```

You'll be prompted the path to place the project, what web framework you want to use, and whether or not you want to use Tailwind

## üìù Add to existing web server

To add Go-SSR to an existing Go web server, take a look at the [examples](/examples) folder to get an idea of what a project looks like. In general, you'll want to follow these commands:

```console
$ go get -u github.com/natewong1313/go-react-ssr
```

Then, add imports into your main file

```go
import (
	...
	go_ssr "github.com/natewong1313/go-react-ssr"
	"github.com/natewong1313/go-react-ssr/config"
	"github.com/natewong1313/go-react-ssr/react_renderer"
)
```

In your main function, initialize the plugin. Create a folder for your structs that hold your props to go, which is called `models` in the below example. You'll also want to create a folder for your React code (called `frontend` in this example) inside your project and specifiy the paths in the config. You may want to clone the [example folder](/examples/frontend/) and use that.

```go
go_ssr.Init(config.Config{
	FrontendDir:        "./frontend/src", // The React source files path
	GeneratedTypesPath: "./frontend/src/generated.d.ts", // Where the generated prop types will be created at
	PropsStructsPath:   "./models/props.go", // Where the Go structs for your prop types are located
})
```

Once the plugin has been initialized, you can call the `react_renderer.RenderRoute` function to compile your React file to a string

```go
g.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
	renderedResponse := react_renderer.RenderRoute(react_renderer.Config{
		File:  "Home.tsx", // The file name, located in FrontendDir
		Title: "My example app", // Set the app title
		MetaTags: map[string]string{ // Configure meta tags
			"og:title":    "My example app",
			"description": "Example description",
		},
		Props: &models.IndexRouteProps{ // Pass in your props struct if you have props
			InitialCount: 0,
		},
	})
	c.Writer.Write(renderedResponse)
})
```
